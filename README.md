This React App is to help multiple users create, plan, and comment on different shared projects. Once you are signed up and logged in, you can see a list of all users on the app and whether or not they are online. You can also create projects, describe them, and assign them to other users. Finally, you can comment on projects and filter them by category.

There was no landing page for this project, so I just went back and made a quick parallax so there was something nice to see on load. This landing page is fully responsive.


### Languages / Tools

React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML

Firebase, Google Fonts, AOS library, FDN library

### Project Highlights

This project was designed so that students could continue practicing React and also work with React Router. It also focused more heavily on incorporating Firebase. Some highlights include:

    1. Usual react stuff like state, useEffect, useHistory, useParams, react router-dom, dynamic routes, forms, redirects
    2. Lots of custom hooks, such as one for using collections and documents from Firestore, using Auth context, Logging users in and out, and signing users up
    3. React Select
    4. Creating a filter to sort projects
    5. FireBase Auth, Storage, FireStore
    6. Saving user thumbnails in Firebase Storage
    7. Creating, adding, and fetching documents from Firestore in order to access user information and project information. This information was used to show lists of users, whether a user was online, and to conditionally show information (such as only the user who created the document could delete it).
    8. Authentication guards for certain routes
    9. Using Firestore Rules to bolster and increase these hard-coded guards
    10. Media Queries for a responsive landing page
    11. Parallax landing page, plus changes to UX on scroll
    

### What I learned / Challenges

This project focused more heavily on interacting with Firebase than other projects have, which was super helpful. However, there are a lot of methods and ways to interact with Firebase that I need to remember and learn in order to feel confident with the service.  I also would get a bit confused sometimes trying to remember which objects had which props (particularly the ones we created)...definitely will be writing those down in the future so I don't get halfway in and have to spend time sorting it all out again. That being said, it seems pretty straightforward to use and it was **extremely** satisfying to work with Firebase and to connect it to the Front-End. I really enjoyed seeing the pieces fit together, and I look forward to exploring Firebase further.

As far as React - I definitely feel pretty comfortable and I understood most of what the instructor walked us through, though of course more practice will make the process quicker. I particularly enjoy hooking things up because it is very puzzle-like (and puzzles are pretty awesome in general).
